MERN Project (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
This is a MERN stack-based project, consisting of MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the backend framework, React.js as the frontend library, and Node.js as the server runtime environment.

Description
This project is a full-stack web application that utilizes the MERN stack to create a simple task management application.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before getting started:

Node.js and npm (latest stable version is recommended)
MongoDB (you can either install it locally or use a cloud database service like MongoDB Atlas)
Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install server dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Navigate to the client directory and also install client dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Navigate back to the project's root directory:
bash
Copy code
cd ..
Database Setup
Before running the application, make sure to set up your MongoDB database. You can either use a local database or one in the cloud. Be sure to provide the connection URL in the respective configuration file.

Running the Application
Once the setup is complete, you can run the application. From the project's root directory, you can start both the server and the client simultaneously using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can access it from your web browser by visiting http://localhost:3000. The application will allow you to manage your tasks, add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.
